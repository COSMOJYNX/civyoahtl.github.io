>[...etc, trust me, this part of the proceedings is not worth it, but if you're a masochist, here you go: https://discord.com/channels/278045721742147586/348687557455904778/858917748817526785]

**GDAN:**

>Aki, Please give your closing statement

**Aki:**

>Ok your honor, I’ll be quick


>This whole trial has been a mess, so let me make the evidence and fact clear here. Shy entered my home, stole my map art and pearls, then left. He also filled my mailbox with shit from public chests. Finally, continually throughout the trial he has been harassing me in discord, in global chat and in DMs. He publically admitted to doing all these things in global chat and in this discord. Longtime friend of the nation and the chief military officer General Neotide saw shy stuff my mailbox.

>Shy just spend the trial faking evidence, wasting time with a testimony that wasn’t relevant in the slightest and making up stories as we went along. While I apologize for his brothers injuries and all, this trial taking a week is simply ridiculous and the fault lies on shy for constantly derailing and failing to produce evidence contrary to what he admitted to doing.

>I urge the court to find Shy guilty

**GDAN:**

>Shygdsamkd, Please proceed to give your closing statement.

**Shygdsamkd:**

>Ok your honor, I’ll be quick

>This whole trial has been a mess, so let me make the evidence and fact clear here. I entered akis home took his pearls and left. I have no idea what mapart he is talking about and i never touches his pickaxes. I was also not the ont to fill his mailbox with shit from public chests. That was Miller and he has already admitted to doing it. The evidence that he provided was circumstantial and the witness can mot be trusted due to his collection of rare diseases. Finally, continually throughout the trial he has been harassing me in discord, in global chat and in DMs. He publically admitted to doing all these things in global chat and in this discord. Longtime friend of the nation and the chief military officer General Neotide saw shy stuff my mailbox.

>Shy just spend the trial faking evidence, wasting time with a testimony that wasn’t relevant in the slightest and making up stories as we went along. While I apologize for his mothers injuries (after we had sex) and all, this trial taking a week is simply ridiculous and the fault lies on shy for constantly derailing and failing to produce evidence contrary to what he admitted to doing.

>I urge the court to find Me not guilty

**GDAN:**

>I find shy guilty of both raiding and harassment. The evidence submitted by Aki shows that Shy admitted to this at the time and Shy has provided no substantial evidence to show that he did not commit the crimes.

>For the crime of raiding I sentence Shy to 2 weeks pearled due to the value of what he took, and for harassment he shall receive a single week. His sentence shall start from today due to his attempts to stall this trial so the time he spent on trial does not count.

>He shall be released on the 31st July.

>For the raiding, as is precedent, he must also repay the value of what was stolen. After consulting with the prosecution this amounts to 64 diamonds. Currently shy is prison pearled due to reports of harassment from other friends on the server and he shall remain prison pearled for the duration of his trial, therefore he'll have 2 weeks upon release to pay his reps. If he does not he shall be exile pearled until he does.

>I would like to make a note that this is the first official time that Shy has been put on trial for harassment but that he has displayed a constant bad attitude and continually harasses others in the discord and in-game. A little trolling is fine, but this level of trolling crosses the line of harassment, he should dial it back and fix his attitude otherwise the next time he is tried for harassment it will likely result in expulsion from the nation and discord.
