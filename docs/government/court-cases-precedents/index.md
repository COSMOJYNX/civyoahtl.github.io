# Case History and Precedents

This is a record of all the court cases in Yoahtl. Our court system works via an ever evolving set of decisions, by the Councillors acting in their capacity as judges in legal disputes. The precedent they set in court has the force of law, but can be challenged by concerned parties. If a separate judicial system were to arise, the existing case precedent would carry over to the new judiciary, since the courts would still be of the same legal essence. Not all decisions create precedent, only those trying new matters.
