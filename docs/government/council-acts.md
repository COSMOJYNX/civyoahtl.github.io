### Council Act 1.3

> ~~Cities should have documented evidence of their consent to joining Yoahtl, and should undergo a trial period as a protectorate before officially joining the Empire to assess their activity level and suitableness for the community; all prospective cities, founded within or outside Yoahtl, must submit a charter outlining their government form, how their senator will be chosen, and why they should be a separate town within Yoahtl. To become a full city, they should also meet the minimum population requirement (5 actives minimum, as determined by the state of reinforcement decay on structures in their town).~~

_(Repealed via Council Act 6.1)_

### Council Act 1.4

> Any group of players wishing to form a town may submit papers of incorporation to the Council of Yoahtl, which are then voted on and the Alcuahtl must sign off. A town may choose to be autonomous, which means that they retain their own legal structure and government. They also are exempt from participating in warfare unless they choose to contribute. They are, however, unable to vote for the Council and choose their own foreign relations except in the realm of trade. Non-autonomous towns retain the Yoahtlan legal code and can vote for the Council. They also cannot form foreign relations. All towns retain the rights to any developed settlements (excludes farms, roads and other minor infrastructure) in the case of inactivity. Existing towns may join Yoahtl as an automatically incorporated town and may choose autonomy at their discretion. Resimere and Pacem retain the rights to all their land in the case of inactivity as per their agreements upon joining Yoahtl.

### Council Act 1.6

> ~~In order to run for council, a candidate (freshman or incumbent) must pay 20d to the national treasury to get on the ballot; this will serve as a fundraiser for national construction projects and other government programs, and (hopefully) give the candidate a sense of investment in the success of the Empire as a whole.
