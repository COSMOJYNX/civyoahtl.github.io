## Proposal One (Passed)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: Spacevolcano, Date: 22nd July 2019

> The current system of proposals is a total shitshow, and after seven months of ineffectiveness last week things came to a head. I think we can all recognize that the system is broken as it is, so I'm taking Orinnari's suggestion and giving it a little structure, as the Chieftain. The way that proposals, charter changes, and the like will be handled from now on is this:
>
> - Somebody makes a proposal.
> - Another person says 'seconded' and others can echo this.
> - This opens a 48 hour period to vote on the proposal.
> - If the proposal passes the citizenry, the Council needs to look at it and either accept it and implement that agenda or they need to reject it and offer valid reasoning.
>
> At the end of the proposal cycle, this channel will be cleared and its contents recorded for posterity so that it's not bogged down.

**Proposal passed**: Votes unknown.
