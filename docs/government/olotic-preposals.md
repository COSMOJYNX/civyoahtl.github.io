## Proposal One (Passed)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: Spacevolcano, Date: 22nd July 2019

> ~~The current system of proposals is a total shitshow, and after seven months of ineffectiveness last week things came to a head. I think we can all recognize that the system is broken as it is, so I'm taking Orinnari's suggestion and giving it a little structure, as the Chieftain. The way that proposals, charter changes, and the like will be handled from now on is this:~~
>
> - ~~Somebody makes a proposal.~~
> - ~~Another person says 'seconded' and others can echo this.~~
> - ~~This opens a 48 hour period to vote on the proposal.~~
> - ~~If the proposal passes the citizenry, the Council needs to look at it and either accept it and implement that agenda or they need to reject it and offer valid reasoning.~~
>
> ~~At the end of the proposal cycle, this channel will be cleared and its contents recorded for posterity so that it's not bogged down.~~

**Proposal passed**: Votes unknown.

_(Amends [The Yoahtlan Charter](/constitution/charter))_

## Proposal Two (Passed)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: SpaceVolcano, Date: 25th July 2019

> Amend the wording of Article IV Section Two from the charter, replacing it with the words "All citizens are afforded one voluntary vote when voting on proposals, confirming nominees to public office, or affirming new citizens to the Ololtic."  
> The current Article IV Section Two states that people are entitled to up to three votes, but this process has never been used and none of the institutions described for affording people their second or third votes have ever been created. In short, it's a dead part of the current charter that runs contrary to the working history and precedent that guides Yoahtlan institutions.  
> In addition, it is the opinion of the government that allowing institutions to privilege certain individuals with greater voting power opens the door to corruption and the presence of this clause within the charter constitutes a potential avenue for votes to be challenged in court over the legitimacy of the voter's ballot. It's overly complicated, we've never used it, and it's potentially dangerous.

**Proposal passed**: Votes unknown.

## Proposal Three (Failed)

Proposer: Lukasmaps, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 25th July 2019

> Currently, proposals are advanced by the citizenry, then voted on by the council. If the council rejects a proposal they provide a reason for its rejection and the citizenry can then override the veto with a 2/3’s majority.  
> Lukas proposal is to eliminate the Council’s review role and instead change the charter so that the High Justice reviews the proposal for constitutionality. In short, the idea is to replace executive review with judicial review.

**Proposal failed**: No Ayes, 13 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Four (Passed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 31st July 2019

> Change the charter so that the high justice’s term length is indefinite (until resignation, impeachment, or quitting) instead of three months. In addition, lower the requirement for removing the High Justice from 67% Ayes from the Ololtic to 60%.

**Proposal passed**: 16 Ayes, 1 Nay, No Abstentions

_(Amends [The Yoahtlan Charter](/constitution/charter))_

## Proposal Five (Passed)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: LukasMaps, Date: 24th August 2019

> The current Charter states that the Alcuahtl is elected by the Council, to be 'first among equals' of their peers. However, the charter doesn't specify that the Alcuahtl has to be from the council. I believe that we should confirm that the Alcuahtl can be anybody and doesn't have to be an existing Councillor to be elected. This proposal would be to confirm this by changing Article II Section 7 from "The Council is responsible for electing the Alcuahtl to be “first among equals” from among their peers." to "The Council is responsible for electing the Alcuahtl from among the Ololtic who are not currently serving as High Justice or other created executive offices to be 'first among equals' from among their peers."

**Proposal passed**: 16 Ayes, 2 Nays, No Abstentions

_(Amends [The Yoahtlan Charter](/constitution/charter))_

## Proposal Six (Failed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 28th August 2019

> Yoahtl's representatives for SATO can only consist of the Alcuahtl, Deputy Alcuahtl, High Justice, and current Councillors. There’s no sense in us restricting ourselves for no good reason, if SATO trusts somebody and we trust them there’s no reason that they shouldn’t be a representative in SATO. This is akin to requiring that America’s representatives at the UN consist of Senators, the President, or the justices of the SCOTUS. In addition, I believe that this violates the charter because the charter clearly states that the Alcuahtl can delegate their authority out to people as needed, so restricting them in this manner is either irrelevant or unconstitutional.

**Proposal failed**: No Ayes, 10 Nays, 1 Abstention

## Proposal Seven (Failed)

Proposer: LukasMaps, Seconded By: Orinnari, Date: 30th August 2019

> Change the proposal voting system so that an abstention is counted as a reduction in the voter pool rather than as a de facto “nay” vote as it is now.

**Proposal failed**: 13 Ayes, 1 Nay, 2 Abstentions

## Proposal Eight (Passed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: Multiple citizens, Date: 31st August 2019

> Modify council law 1.4  
> Current text:
>
> > Any group of players wishing to form a town may submit papers of incorporation to the Council of Yoahtl, which are then voted on and the Alcuahtl must sign off. A town may choose to be autonomous, which means that they retain their own legal structure, rights to their land in the event of them going inactive, and government. They also are exempt from participating in warfare unless they choose to contribute. They are, however, unable to vote for the Council and choose their own foreign relations except in the realm of trade. Non-autonomous towns retain the Yoahtlan legal code and can vote for the Council. They also cannot form foreign relations. Existing towns may join Yoahtl as an automatically incorporated town and may choose autonomy at their discretion.

**Proposal passed**: 21 Ayes, No Nays, 1 Abstention

_(Amends [Council Act 1.4](/government/council-acts#council-act-1-4))_

## Proposal Nine (Failed)

Proposer: Orinnari, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 4th September 2019

> Commercial ventures such as http://civmall.ml/ that are able to precisely track their income must pay import tax if the delivery drop chest is within Yoahtl's borders.

**Proposal failed**: 8 Ayes, 10 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Ten (Failed)

Proposer: Orinnari, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 5th September 2019

> The law should be changed so that citizens must register to vote to take part in Ololtic duties (ie: voting). It would by extension act as a form of citizens' census. This would require a physical place set up in game for citizens to register via screenshot, with certain details replaced daily or weekly to prevent registration fraud. Proposals will then only need 50% of those who bother to participate in our nations politics, rather than requiring people such as GDAN to ping people. One's voter registration lasts thirty days.

**Proposal failed**: 2 Ayes, 8 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Eleven (Passed)

Proposer: alzdadog, Seconded By: LukasMaps, Date: 9th September 2019

> ~~Citizens who do not vote on a bill are no longer counted as Nay but are instead subtracted from the voter pool during the count. To ensure that everything remains fair though there shall be a 2/3 quorum (meaning unless 2/3 of citizens participate then the bill is automatically rejected.)~~

## Proposal Twelve (Failed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 13th September 2019

> Any Basements either created or extended after 14/09/2019 should not pass beyond the boundaries of ones plot.

**Proposal failed**: 2 Ayes, 13 Nays, 3 Abstentions

## Proposal Thirteen (Failed)

Proposer: LukasMaps, Seconded By: Sventhar, Date: 14th September 2019

> Formally name NYC as NYC and the island it's situated on as Nixotlan.  
> Background: Currently both the island and the city are formally named Nixotlan, but obviously nobody uses that name. In colloquial usage, the city is referred to as NYC and the island is nameless. This proposal would have the dual effect of solidifying the name people already call NYC by as it’s actual legal name and also making it easier to talk about the island NYC is on by being able to call it by one word (Nixotlan) instead of the much more clunky “The island NYC is on.”

**Proposal failed**: 13 Ayes, 2 Nays, 2 Abstentions (Quorum not met)

## Proposal Fourteen (Passed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: LukasMaps, Date: 25th September 2019

> To become a citizen of Yoahtl proper you must a) be a resident of Yoahtl proper, and b) request a vote in the citizenship-votes channel where a majority from the Ololtic will constitute a pass.  
> (Other direct agreements with the government such as treaties of autonomous towns do not have to follow such rules, however they must be agreed by a majority council vote.)  
> Reason for proposal: This clarifies the method of becoming a citizen, it means that at least it's documented somewhere so even if a new resident can't find it a citizen will probably be able to tell them how to become a citizen.

**Proposal passed**: 14 Ayes, No Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Fifteen (Withdrawn)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: iOminous, Date: 25th September 2019

> Eliminate #politics_irl and all other channels regarding politics or real life drama which causes internal drama or incites unneeded conflict between Yoahtlans, foreigners, or any other individuals who would otherwise exist in this discord unmolested and undisturbed.

**Proposal withdrawn**: 2 Ayes, 9 Nays, 2 Abstentions

## Proposal Sixteen (Failed)

Proposer: F1SH98, Seconded By: Sventhar, Date: 25th September 2019

> Officially ban all mining within the claims of Yoahtl Proper, including but not limited to, Okashima and Odresh. Domestic mining creates abandoned shafts underneath cities that can potentially be used to launch an attack against the settlement, but more importantly, they drain our valuable domestic resources sooner, rather than later. All mining should be limited to foreign or unclaimed lands before we mine in our sovereign territory as a matter of strategic importance.

**Proposal failed**: 2 Ayes, No Nays, No Abstentions (Ruled Unconstitutional)

## Proposal Seventeen (Failed)

Proposer: Crusher, Seconded By: Klari, Date: 7th October 2019

> Proposal to review election procedures to require an entirely secret ballot to prevent the swaying of the election based on public opinion should someone decide to vote publicly.

**Proposal failed**: 3 Ayes, 13 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Eighteen (Failed)

Proposer: Feathercrown, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 11th October 2019

> Change Council Law 6.5 from
>
> > "Dual citizens who do not have primary residence in Yoahtl or hold office in any other nation are ineligible to run for Council."
>
> to
>
> > "Dual citizens who do not have primary residence in Yoahtl Proper or who hold office in any other nation unless said nation is made up of entirely primary residents of Yoahtl Proper are ineligible to run for Council."

Proposal failed: 3 Ayes, 5 Nays, 3 Abstentions

## Proposal Nineteen (Failed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: Orinnari, Date: 14th October 2019

> I'd like to make a proposal that candidates cannot initiate PMs about the elections/candidacy/voting with non-candidates from the time that the candidacy announcement post has been made until the new council is in power.

**Proposal failed**: 6 Ayes, 9 Nays, 1 Abstention

## Proposal Twenty (Passed)

Proposer: Okx, Seconded By: Orinnari, Date: 17th October 2019

> ~~Change the quorum to 50%~~

Proposal passed: 15 Ayes, 1 Nay, 6 Abstentions

_(Amends [The Yoahtlan Charter](/constitution/charter))_

## Proposal Twenty One (Passed)

Proposer: The People of Okashima, Seconded By: TheAdvisor, Date: 17th October 2019

> Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government”  
> We the people of Okashima, hereby request the implementation of the following proposal:  
> "Establish a government minister position for the leader of Okashima, known as the Minister of Okashima; who is henceforth to be elected from residents of the territory every two months, while removing the permanent position of Oudai which is currently held by F1sh98. The Minister will serve the town of Okato and the territory of Okashima in day to day management as well as communicating the needs of the town with the Yoahtlan government. In controversial decisions by the Minister the residents will have the power to challenge said decision, with it then going to a 2/3rds majority vote among all active residents of the territory. Residents can also call for a vote of no confidence in the Minister at any time, and with a 2/3rds majority vote removing him from office.  
> We in Okashima feel this is necessary due to the blatant abuses of office committed by F1sh98 in his permanent position of Oudai. This position has no checks on its power, essentially forcing us to live in a despotic dictatorship. We do not wish to kick F1sh out of town, take any property he possesses, or revoke his right to live in Okashima. we simply want the town to be led by an elected official with the citizens all having a say in the direction of the town."  
> We have gone directly to him with the changes we want, and the response was "It'll be a cold day in hell when you take my town from me". He is not satisfied with anything less than a permanent government position, believing himself above the citizens who toil under his rule. Since we have exhausted all other reasonable options, we haven now been forced to come to you, the people of Yoahtl, directly for help in our current efforts of democratization.  
> While we are rejecting our own internal rule, we do still wish to remain loyal to the great nation of Yoahtl. We thank you for allowing us to grow with you and we hope to further strengthen our bonds by redeveloping the way we are governed.

**Proposal passed**: 16 Ayes, 2 Nays, 6 Abstentions

## Proposal Twenty Two (Failed)

Proposer: iOminous, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 16th December 2019

> Councillor Candidate Tax  
> Allow for the government to set a poll tax on all candidates interested in running. The tax will go to the nations treasury and incumbent candidates will not be allowed use public funds (they’ll need to be privately funded). I think wealth is a good indication of a players activity and it seems reasonable.

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: Okx, Date: 14th February 2020

> Amend Article II Section 5 of the Third National Charter from the following text:
>
> > Councillors will be elected to a term of 2 months by a popular vote. Citizens may pick up to 3 candidates to >cast their ballots for, and the candidates with the 3 highest vote totals will comprise the council for that term.  
> > a. The council shall be composed of 3 members minimum, with additional seats added for every 6 citizens beyond 12.  
> > b. Councillors may resign at any time, for any reason, so long as they appoint a deputy to fill in for them if >needed before an official replacement is elected. An interim election should be held within one week of a >resignation to choose an official replacement.
>
> To the following text:
>
> > Councillors shall be elected to a term of two months by single transferable vote. The top candidates by popular vote shall become Councillors for that term.  
> > a. The council shall be composed of three members, with one additional member for every six valid voters past 12.  
> > b. Councillors may resign at any time and shall be replaced by the next most popular vote getter in the previous election who still meets the qualifications to be Councillor and who still has affirmative interest in serving on the Council.

## Proposal Twenty Five (Passed)

Proposer: MightyOddish, Seconded By: nico0078, Date: 17th February 2020

> ~~Proposals as they currently are are rather troublesome. To fix this any person can suggest a proposal and then awaits a member of council to second the motion, then the proposal. is posted up as a proposal (as we currently do). Then the council vote on said proposal as a primary vote. if the vote passes with a 2/3rd majority it goes to the citizenry to vote on a second round. the citizenry can then vote on said proposal in or out. In which it will require only a 60% majority of people who have voted to be passed or rejected. If the council however vote the proposal and reject it. the second round of voting will still go through in which citizens will vote. If it is wanted 90% of votes would have to be an 'aye' for it to pass through the councils rejection, if the 90% ayes is not reached then he proposal is rejected. ( this is deliberately worded to only count people who have actively voted. all non votes are subsequently not counted in the percentiles.)~~  
> ~~This is a test of the new system. After a 3 week trial if this proposed system doesn't suit the needs or is disliked by the majority we will revert to our current system and look for another idea to fix voting issues.~~

> ~~Change the requirement for the current trial proposal system so that in the second round of voting by citizens, it only requires a 75% aye vote from the citizens who vote to overturn a council vote of Nay in the first round of voting. This lowers the requirement since I know many believe the current 90% requirement to be too high.~~

Proposer: nico0078, Seconded By: UNKOWN, Date: 3rd March 2020

> Any citizen can start a proposal, and it must be seconded by a different citizen after a period of discussion of any length during which the specifics of the law are discussed and revisions suggested. Once seconded, voting opens for the next 48 hours, during which additional discussion may occur. If the proposer wishes to include revisions from this additional discussion, they may update their proposal, at which point the voting period and votes both reset. Once voting closes, the proposal passes if there are more aye votes than nay votes and at least 1/3 of the citizenry has voted aye (or 2/3rds in the case of charter amendments).  
> Councillors can also pass legislation. Any council member may start a proposal, and it is passed and becomes law if 2/3 of the councillors approve the proposal by voting aye. However, if at least as many citizens as there are council members express their desire to revoke this law, the law is temporarily suspended and a proposal is created to veto the Council's law.  
> Laws passed by the Council may not override laws passed by the Ololtic. The Council may not re-propose a law vetoed by the Ololtic for a period of one month.

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: ComradeRick, Date: 6th August 2020

> ~~Ashelor has formally requested to me to be admitted to Yoahtl as a non-autonomous town. The terms of the deal are as follows, like all normal incorporations of such towns:~~
>
> - ~~Ashelor and its currently held territory will join Yoahtl and be incorporated under the existing governmental structure of Ashelor~~
> - ~~Ashelor's government will cede the authority over military affairs and citizenship to Yoahtl, but will retain its own player residency doctrines and rules and maintain the ability to enter into nonmilitary trade, diplomatic, and infrastructure relationships with foreign nations provided doing so doesn't interfere directly with Yoahtlan military affairs, subject to the limits of strict scrutiny in Yoahtlan courts against any Yoahtlan governmental interference. By default unless the Yoahtlan federal government can prove it to be necessary to intervene instance by instance, Ashelor will retain these liberties. This is standard policy and affirms the existing historical circumstances of all non-autonomous towns~~
> - ~~Orinnari and Aleh will become normal Yoahtlan citizens, assuming they aren't already~~
> - ~~the Great Overland Rail Corporation will prioritize an eastward extension of the GOR once bgbba has better internet to properly connect Ashelor to the GOR network~~ > ~~Citizens and trusted residents of Ashelor will be allowed all rights, privileges, freedoms, and liberties within NYC afforded to all citizens of Yoahtl including the right to access NYC and participate in the federal Yoahtlan institutions freely~~
>
> ~~This proposal requires the assent of a majority of Councillors, the Alcuahtl, and a majority of existing citizens.~~
