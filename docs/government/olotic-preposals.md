## Proposal One (Passed)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: Spacevolcano, Date: 22nd July 2019

> ~~The current system of proposals is a total shitshow, and after seven months of ineffectiveness last week things came to a head. I think we can all recognize that the system is broken as it is, so I'm taking Orinnari's suggestion and giving it a little structure, as the Chieftain. The way that proposals, charter changes, and the like will be handled from now on is this:~~
>
> - ~~Somebody makes a proposal.~~
> - ~~Another person says 'seconded' and others can echo this.~~
> - ~~This opens a 48 hour period to vote on the proposal.~~
> - ~~If the proposal passes the citizenry, the Council needs to look at it and either accept it and implement that agenda or they need to reject it and offer valid reasoning.~~
>
> ~~At the end of the proposal cycle, this channel will be cleared and its contents recorded for posterity so that it's not bogged down.~~

**Proposal passed**: Votes unknown.

_(Amends [The Yoahtlan Charter](/constitution/charter))_

## Proposal Two (Passed)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: SpaceVolcano, Date: 25th July 2019

> Amend the wording of Article IV Section Two from the charter, replacing it with the words "All citizens are afforded one voluntary vote when voting on proposals, confirming nominees to public office, or affirming new citizens to the Ololtic."  
> The current Article IV Section Two states that people are entitled to up to three votes, but this process has never been used and none of the institutions described for affording people their second or third votes have ever been created. In short, it's a dead part of the current charter that runs contrary to the working history and precedent that guides Yoahtlan institutions.  
> In addition, it is the opinion of the government that allowing institutions to privilege certain individuals with greater voting power opens the door to corruption and the presence of this clause within the charter constitutes a potential avenue for votes to be challenged in court over the legitimacy of the voter's ballot. It's overly complicated, we've never used it, and it's potentially dangerous.

**Proposal passed**: Votes unknown.

## Proposal Three (Failed)

Proposer: Lukasmaps, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 25th July 2019

> Currently, proposals are advanced by the citizenry, then voted on by the council. If the council rejects a proposal they provide a reason for its rejection and the citizenry can then override the veto with a 2/3’s majority.  
> Lukas proposal is to eliminate the Council’s review role and instead change the charter so that the High Justice reviews the proposal for constitutionality. In short, the idea is to replace executive review with judicial review.

**Proposal failed**: No Ayes, 13 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Four (Passed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 31st July 2019

> Change the charter so that the high justice’s term length is indefinite (until resignation, impeachment, or quitting) instead of three months. In addition, lower the requirement for removing the High Justice from 67% Ayes from the Ololtic to 60%.

**Proposal passed**: 16 Ayes, 1 Nay, No Abstentions

_(Amends [The Yoahtlan Charter](/constitution/charter))_

## Proposal Five (Passed)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: LukasMaps, Date: 24th August 2019

> The current Charter states that the Alcuahtl is elected by the Council, to be 'first among equals' of their peers. However, the charter doesn't specify that the Alcuahtl has to be from the council. I believe that we should confirm that the Alcuahtl can be anybody and doesn't have to be an existing Councillor to be elected. This proposal would be to confirm this by changing Article II Section 7 from "The Council is responsible for electing the Alcuahtl to be “first among equals” from among their peers." to "The Council is responsible for electing the Alcuahtl from among the Ololtic who are not currently serving as High Justice or other created executive offices to be 'first among equals' from among their peers."

**Proposal passed**: 16 Ayes, 2 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Six (Failed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 28th August 2019

> Yoahtl's representatives for SATO can only consist of the Alcuahtl, Deputy Alcuahtl, High Justice, and current Councillors. There’s no sense in us restricting ourselves for no good reason, if SATO trusts somebody and we trust them there’s no reason that they shouldn’t be a representative in SATO. This is akin to requiring that America’s representatives at the UN consist of Senators, the President, or the justices of the SCOTUS. In addition, I believe that this violates the charter because the charter clearly states that the Alcuahtl can delegate their authority out to people as needed, so restricting them in this manner is either irrelevant or unconstitutional.

**Proposal failed**: No Ayes, 10 Nays, 1 Abstention

## Proposal Seven (Failed)

Proposer: LukasMaps, Seconded By: Orinnari, Date: 30th August 2019

> Change the proposal voting system so that an abstention is counted as a reduction in the voter pool rather than as a de facto “nay” vote as it is now.

**Proposal failed**: 13 Ayes, 1 Nay, 2 Abstentions

## Proposal Eight (Passed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: Multiple citizens, Date: 31st August 2019

> Modify council law 1.4  
> Current text:
>
> > Any group of players wishing to form a town may submit papers of incorporation to the Council of Yoahtl, which are then voted on and the Alcuahtl must sign off. A town may choose to be autonomous, which means that they retain their own legal structure, rights to their land in the event of them going inactive, and government. They also are exempt from participating in warfare unless they choose to contribute. They are, however, unable to vote for the Council and choose their own foreign relations except in the realm of trade. Non-autonomous towns retain the Yoahtlan legal code and can vote for the Council. They also cannot form foreign relations. Existing towns may join Yoahtl as an automatically incorporated town and may choose autonomy at their discretion.

Existing towns may join Yoahtl as an automatically incorporated town and may choose autonomy at their discretion. Resimere and Pacem retain the rights to all their land in the case of inactivity as per their agreements upon joining Yoahtl.

**Proposal passed**: 21 Ayes, No Nays, 1 Abstention

_(Amends [Council Act 1.4](/government/council-acts#council-act-1-4))_

## Proposal Nine (Failed)

Proposer: Orinnari, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 4th September 2019

> Commercial ventures such as http://civmall.ml/ that are able to precisely track their income must pay import tax if the delivery drop chest is within Yoahtl's borders.

**Proposal failed**: 8 Ayes, 10 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Ten (Failed)

Proposer: Orinnari, Seconded By: bgbba, Date: 5th September 2019

> The law should be changed so that citizens must register to vote to take part in Ololtic duties (ie: voting). It would by extension act as a form of citizens' census. This would require a physical place set up in game for citizens to register via screenshot, with certain details replaced daily or weekly to prevent registration fraud. Proposals will then only need 50% of those who bother to participate in our nations politics, rather than requiring people such as GDAN to ping people. One's voter registration lasts thirty days.

**Proposal failed**: 2 Ayes, 8 Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Eleven (Passed)

Proposer: alzdadog, Seconded By: LukasMaps, Date: 9th September 2019

> ~~Citizens who do not vote on a bill are no longer counted as Nay but are instead subtracted from the voter pool during the count. To ensure that everything remains fair though there shall be a 2/3 quorum (meaning unless 2/3 of citizens participate then the bill is automatically rejected.)~~

Proposal passed: 19 Ayes, 1 Nay, No Abstentions

## Proposal Twelve (Failed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: WackyAki, Date: 13th September 2019

> Any Basements either created or extended after 14/09/2019 should not pass beyond the boundaries of ones plot.

**Proposal failed**: 2 Ayes, 13 Nays, 3 Abstentions

## Proposal Thirteen (Failed)

Proposer: LukasMaps, Seconded By: Sventhar, Date: 14th September 2019

> Formally name NYC as NYC and the island it's situated on as Nixotlan.  
> Background: Currently both the island and the city are formally named Nixotlan, but obviously nobody uses that name. In colloquial usage, the city is referred to as NYC and the island is nameless. This proposal would have the dual effect of solidifying the name people already call NYC by as it’s actual legal name and also making it easier to talk about the island NYC is on by being able to call it by one word (Nixotlan) instead of the much more clunky “The island NYC is on.”

**Proposal failed**: 13 Ayes, 2 Nays, 2 Abstentions (Quorum not met)

## Proposal Fourteen (Passed)

Proposer: GDAN12, Seconded By: LukasMaps, Date: 25th September 2019

> To become a citizen of Yoahtl proper you must a) be a resident of Yoahtl proper, and b) request a vote in the citizenship-votes channel where a majority from the Ololtic will constitute a pass.  
> (Other direct agreements with the government such as treaties of autonomous towns do not have to follow such rules, however they must be agreed by a majority council vote.)  
> Reason for proposal: This clarifies the method of becoming a citizen, it means that at least it's documented somewhere so even if a new resident can't find it a citizen will probably be able to tell them how to become a citizen.

**Proposal passed**: 14 Ayes, No Nays, No Abstentions

## Proposal Fifteen (Withdrawn)

Proposer: bgbba, Seconded By: iOminous, Date: 25th September 2019

> Eliminate #politics_irl and all other channels regarding politics or real life drama which causes internal drama or incites unneeded conflict between Yoahtlans, foreigners, or any other individuals who would otherwise exist in this discord unmolested and undisturbed.

**Proposal withdrawn**: 2 Ayes, 9 Nays, 2 Abstentions
